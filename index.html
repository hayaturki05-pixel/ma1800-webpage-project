      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p class="Abstract">Several social media platforms shadow ban contents that revolve around the 
      genocide occuring in Palestine from Isreal's inhumane occupation. 
      The intent behind this is to create censorship and enhance the propaganda surrounding 
      the reality of Palestinians immense grief and loss for their family members and homeland. 
      The following will be centered around the primary media outlets Meta (Instagram and Facebook), Tiktok, YouTube, and its general AI data surveillance of palestines content posts.</p>

         <h2>Meta</h2>
        <p class="Meta">Jordana Cutler, a previously major Israeli official who is now Meta's policy manager for Israel, advocated for the restriction of Instagram photos by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), an association opposed to Israel's enforced genocide in Gaza. Private exchanges revealed that Cutler identified at least four SJP articles using Meta's Dangerous Organizations and Individuals guidelines, which aims to minimize the spread of a hidden blacklist while allowing for political debate. The results of these reported posts remain unknown, as Meta did not provide any additional information. However, concerns have been raised regarding ‘a senior employee’ assigned with presenting the government objectives which argue for supressing user content that opposes to those. Critics, including digital rights campaigner Marwa Fatafta, have questioned Cutler's position in content moderation, citing potential prejudice. Meta justified its methods by claiming that the identity of the individual reporting information is irrelevant but declined to elaborate when contacted by The Intercept.</p>

      <h2>TikTok</h2>
      <p class="Tiktok">Throughout November 2024, Tayseer Obaid, 42, a Palestinian fisherman in Gaza, documented the renovation of a tent lived with nine family members on TikTok. Obaid, who had been displaced nine times because of the ongoing genocide, wanted to provide a pleasant setting for his children. He posted recordings of his attempts to add comforts like as storage and a swing, which concluded in a tour of the finished tent. His content has gone viral, raising awareness about the realities in Gaza during the massacre. However, developing social media content is difficult due to restricted access to the internet and power outages. Despite these challenges, Obaid continues to share his story.</p1>

       <h2>YouTube</h2>
        <p class = "YouTube">A documentary addresses the challenges of mothers impacted by Israel's attacks on Gaza, as well as findings into the death of a Palestinian American journalist and the demolition of Palestinian houses in the occupied West Bank. In early October, YouTube removed films posted by three significant Palestinian civil rights associations: Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. This incident came as the US administration launched a campaign to minimize responsibility for suspected Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank. The removed streams contained considerable material demonstrating reported breaches of international law by the Israeli government, such as the death of Palestinian people.</p>

      <h2>AI Surveillance</h2>
      <p class = "AI-Surveillance">Approximately 100 pages of emails, pictures, and videos gathered under FOIA show the growing efficiency of federal agencies' surveillance of protesters. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), a law enforcement branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is in charge of securing about 10,000 US government buildings. This law enforcement unit is prepared to apply their typical roles into society. However, many people are unaware with FPS, its existence is crucial because protests and rallies are frequently held near federal buildings, implying that these events are certainly being monitored by FPS.</p>
