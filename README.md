Echoes of Gaza, is a webart that is in a form of a newspaper; creating this to be a digital newspaper. Despite that, because the genocide in Gaza truly began in the year of 1948, not in 2023 as most are misled by, I didn't include real time images of the destruction of Gaza as those digital platforms were nonexistential throughout the world to simply post and have users worlwide view them. I wished to keep that historical sense alive where I mainly focus on the governmental and societal aspect of it. The webart newspaper's purpose is to shed more awareness regarding the genocide on palestine enforced by the israeli occupation particularly the social media censorship on pro-palestine contents on the primary platforms presented; Meta, Tiktok, Youtube, and AI Surveillance. The process of this digital newspaper is to click either on the row pages to view the contents on them or go to the following on the bottom center where eventually it returns back to the intial home page. While gaining the ability to become more informed on the realities of palestinians endurance in their occupation and bombardment that has them grief immensely of their family members and the loss of their homeland. Additionally, challenges that I encountered throughout constructing this webart newspaper was solving my issue on having certain information and images where I desired to place them to appear in a format presented in an actual newspaper. This consumed plenty of time and required perserverance, dedication, and research to eventually discover a solution that solved this problem.  

Some inspiration that influenced my webart newspaper are the 100 Websites: Abstract Browsing - Rafael Rozendaal, and the MTAA (1997): Simple Net Art Diagram. With the work on Abstract Bowsing by Rafeal Rozendaal, it created me to build on the structure and appearance of my home page with where my title is placed, and the two images there. Where I implemented my title 'Echoes of Gaza' to be at the top center with a red background. To elaborate, their wild colors lit an idea where I could have the colors of this newspaper page to further highlight palestine to use their designated flag colors where as appeared not just the red for the title section and the footer but the green is included as the main background for the text placement, white, and black as the text color to bring that aspect and inference on the purpose of my digital newspaper. Though with the Simple Net Art Diagram in 1997 by the MTAA, it more so inspired the placements on where I could have my text to resemble the nearest to a newspaper format on the homepage, however, it got me brainstorming my creativities on how I could similarly implement those sections into my main pages as well as adapting on what I am already familiar with what a newspaper format and structure looks like which is the columns and rows of content. Furthermore, the Simple Nert Art Diagram with the Abstract Browsing, assisted on where with those columns and rows structure that the content and images need to be aligned yet scrambled overall to not look repetitive and identical as a newspaper contains various layouts yet are aligned with the text.  

if I were to be given the opportunity to extend my project with having more time or resources it would be mainly on the aesthetics as those are the priority with web arts. I believe I incorporated the fundamental and significant aesthetical aspects on my newspaper webart, however, I would have wished to have more time or resources to advance that. Such as paying more attention to the newspaper details like the title. I could have had it to be more graphical as it is with taking their applicable sizes, fonts, designs into more consideration. Along with creating a more distinction in the layouts presented in my main pages when compared to each other. With it being intertwined with research, having the additional time to spend figuring out the range of possibilities this could be implemented to enhance my creativity and originality further would have been what I would dedicate the extra time for. Overall, I am proud and pleased with the skills I just could have applied this more and I was unable to be detailed with more of the palestinian symbols and graphics I pitched because my major challenge mentioned and huge factor in a newspaper (the placements of text and images) consumed most of time. Therefore, this would be the intiative I would have taken if given that additional time. 

These are the images and information I recieved from these following news outlet links and a credible dissertation (the TikTok page information) which unfortunately won't link:
