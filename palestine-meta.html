      <h2>Meta</h2>
    <h3>Government Role </h3>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">In 2016, According to the Intercept, Jordana Cutler worked with Meta; Instagram and Facebooks ownership. Cutler joined Meta in 2016 following a extensive involvement in the Israeli government, holding positions in Washington, D.C  at the Israeli Embassy, where she worked in public relations and was chief of the workforce. She also served as a Likud campaign consultant, working directly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gilad Erdan, a former minister, welcomed her hire as a big step forward in Israel's relationship with Facebook. Cutler has openly recognized her role as Meta's connection with the Israeli government, representing Israeli views within the corporation.  </p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">Cutler, in 2017, revealed the Israeli business publication Calcalist that Facebook works actively with Israel's Ministry of Justice, the police, and security services such as Shin Bet to coordinate content removal initiatives, noting their experience in the field. Based in a 2020 article in the Jerusalem Post, Cutler is "our woman at Facebook," appointed with communicating both Facebook's ideas to Israel and Israel's opinions to Facebook. In a recent interview, she described her work as an avenue for Israeli policies within the company, claiming that Facebook responds to these complaints and emphasizing the chance she has to contribute to policy discussions and clarify Israel-related issues. </p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">Meta's government connections and campaigns for change are broad, but it lacks specialized top-tier contacts in certain regions, especially for Palestinians. While there is one regulation administrator for millions of Middle Eastern users and others for Southeast Asia's almost 700 million individuals, this has created worries about inequality of power in filtering comments about the continuing genocide, which has killed at least 40,000 Gazans. Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation highlighted that for Meta to act morally, it must consider Palestinian perspectives in its methods for making decisions. </p>
    <h3>Content Moderation Selection </h3>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">From records investigated by The Intercept, Jordana Cutler, argued for the removal of posts from Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) featuring books by authors affiliated with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Although the DFLP was taken off from the US terrorist list in 1999 owing to insufficient evidence of terrorist activity, the PFLP remains recognized as a terrorist group. Cutler's advocacy work focused on posts quoting Palestinian novelist Ghassan Kanafani, a PFLP representative, as well as SJP articles on Leila Khaled, a prior PFLP participant noted for her empowerment. </p>

 <div class="sub-container"> 
        <p class="sub-paragraph">Emerson Brooking, an influential associate at the Atlantic Council, cited Ankhi Das, Facebook's former policy leader for India, who stepped down in 2020 after a report exposed her advocacy for flawed hate speech enforced regulations that favored India's ruling Hindu political movement. Brooking observed that, while Meta functions as an international networking platform, not every voice are reflected equally. </p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">During this period, Cutler identified multiple posts from SJP UCLA, including content about PFLP-related authors and a "PFLP study group." Concerns were filed over Meta's enforcement activities impacting SJP's Instagram account, with occurrences recorded by SJP groups across institutions, that included deactivation and post removal. Cutler's connections to Meta and government leaders are significant; she is not alone in forging relationships between Meta and government entities, as employees in content moderation frequently have histories in government organizations. Cutler was reportedly considered for a position in the Israeli government's Strategic Affairs Ministry, which is recognized for leveraging Meta platforms for monitoring and propaganda against protesters. This association presents difficulties, as stated by Stanford Law's Evelyn Douek, who is concerned about possible prejudices in content enforcement. Douek advocates for a clear distinction between the development and implementation of speech laws to avoid governmental interests from unjustly affecting the execution of policies. </p>

    <h3>The Influence of their Applied Censorship</h3>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">Meta's restrictions have been accused of banning pro-Palestinian content on Instagram and Facebook during the ongoing Israeli- Palestinian genocide. Between October and November 2023, Human Rights Watch documented more than 1,050 cases of content restriction, the majority of which targeted nonviolent displays of support for Palestine. According to the research, Meta's inconsistent implementation of its policies resulted in significant limits on users' capacity to participate with Palestinian-related content, such as account suspensions and post deletions. Systematic issues in Meta's Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy, as well as susceptibility to governmental content removal requests and a dependence on automatic filtering systems, all contribute to this problem. Despite continued campaigning and requests for reform, Meta's actions during recent attacks demonstrate a failing to honour agreements to support Palestine's freedom of speech. </p>

        <img src="images/palestine-meta3.jpg" width="400" height="300"> 
        <p class="sub-paragraph">Instagram and Facebook have taken down or entirely deactivated the accounts of numerous Palestinian content providers, journalists, and activists. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, a journalist with nearly one million followers, reported losing ownership of his account five times. He stated that he could not use resources to check for account violations, and others who attempted to tag him received warnings about incorrect information or Community Guidelines violations. Another journalist, Saleh Jafawari’s account was deleted after his recent assassination on October 12.  Jafawari’ documented several footages of Gaza’s state after Israelis committed war crimes. He was kidnapped, beaten, then shot. Even prior to his death he his verified Instagram account was momentarily shut down, consisting of 4.5 million followers. Meta, without providing evidence to back their justification on it supposedly aligning with “dangerous organization and dangerous individuals. This is to silence Palestinian outlets while spreading propaganda to undermine the intensity of the genocide.  </p>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">Since October 7, Human Rights Watch has identified over 1,000 incidents of unjust content removal related to Palestine on Instagram and Facebook. This suppression impacts posts and accounts that report human rights violations and occurs globally, with content coming from more than 60 nations. Censorship tendencies detected include post removal, account suspensions, activity limits, and "shadow banning." Users have faced overlapping restrictions and elevated penalties for content misconduct. Some people noted a lack of clarification from Meta about the exact policies being implemented.  findings indicate that the platforms have failed to meet their "human rights due diligence" requirements on a consistent level. </p>
