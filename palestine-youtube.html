  <h3>Googles Complicity in YouTube's Censorship</h3>
  <p class="sub-paragraph">I'm pretty shocked that YouTube has displayed such a little backbone," said Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. "It's difficult to formulate a credible case that sharing information from Palestinian human rights organizations would violate regulations. Accepting to this unjustified categorization of these Palestinian organizations, and now censoring them, is disappointing and surprising."</p>
  <p class="sub-paragraph">"It is outrageous that YouTube continues to advance the Trump administration's objective by concealing evidence of human rights violations and war crimes from public view," stated Katherine Gallagher, an executive lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights. YouTube, which is operated by Google, acknowledged to The Intercept that it removed the groups' accounts as an immediate outcome of State Department penalties imposed following a review. The Trump administration implemented restrictions on the groups in September for their collaboration with the International Criminal Court in instances involving Israeli officers accused of war crimes.</p>
  <p class="sub-paragraph">"Google is committed to complying with relevant regulations and trade cooperation laws," YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle stated.  Al Mezan, a Gaza-based human rights organization, informed The Intercept that its YouTube account was unexpectedly stopped this year on October 7 without any warning beforehand. "Terminating the channel deprives us from reaching what we aspire to convey our message to, and fulfill our mission," the organization's spokesman stated, "and hinders us from reaching our goals and restricts our ability to reach the audience we aim to convey our message with."</p>
  <p class="sub-paragraph">The West Bank-based Al-Haq's stream was terminated on October 3, according to a spokeswoman for the organization, with a statement from YouTube stating that its "content violates our guidelines." "YouTube's deletion of a human rights organisation's network, which was conducted without any prior notification, indicates a serious oversight of values and a major setback for human rights and freedom of speech," a statement from Al-Haq said. "The U.S. Regulations are being used to undermine responsibility efforts in Palestine and suppress Palestinian voices and victims, and this has implications for others on such platforms that operate within such restrictions that continue to silence Palestinian voices."</p>

    <p class="sub-paragraph">"YouTube's choice to shut down PCHR's account is essentially one of the numerous repercussions that we as an organization have endured upon the decision of the US government to penalize our organisations for our legitimate work," said Basel al-Sourani, a global representation officer and attorney for the group. "YouTube said that we didn't adhere to their policy on Community Guidelines, when our work was simply providing factual and evidence-based reporting on the atrocities carried out against the Palestinian people particularly given the beginning of the ongoing genocide on 7 October."</p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">"By doing so, YouTube is being implicated in silencing the voices of Palestinian victims," according to al-Sourani. According to Intercept, the three human rights groups' account removals cumulate to a total of more than 700 videos. The deleted footage consist of examinations, such as a study of Israel's murder towards Shireen Abu Akleh, an American journalist to account of Palestinians oppression by Israeli forces, and films like "The Beach," regarding children killed by an Israeli strike while playing on a beach.</p>

    <p class="sub-paragraph">"The Trump administration has concentrated on facilitating to the censorship of news coverage of Israeli crimes in Palestine, and the measures taken against these organizations are very intentionally meant to form connections with these organizations alarming to Americans who will be worried about'   material support' laws," said Whitson of DAWN, which joined an alliance of groups in September urging that the Trump administration lift the restrictions.</p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">YouTube, like many other technology companies, has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with requests from both the Trump administration and Israel. YouTube collaborated with an Israeli IT worker-led campaign to remove social media postings criticizing Israel. Google, YouTube's major firm, secretly turned over confidential Gmail account information to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in order to jail a pro-Palestinian student organizer. Prior to Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza, YouTube had been suspected of selectively censoring Palestinian voices while ignoring pro-Israeli content. Such trends persisted during the war, according to a Wired investigation.</p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">The Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association's official YouTube account had been taken down earlier this year. The action came in response to advocacy from UK Lawyers for Israel, who addressed to YouTube pointing out that the association had been blacklisted by the State Department. Whitson expressed concern that YouTube's admission might set the tone for forcing other tech companies to give in to censorship. "They are practically permitting the Trump administration to control what knowledge they share with the world," she explained. "It's not going to end with Palestine."</p>

    <h3>Source for identifying's Criminal Acts by Israeli</h3>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">The Hind Rajab Foundation is a legitimate non-governmental organisation with Belgian registration. It carries the name of a five-year-old Gazan girl who was murdered by Israeli forces in January 2024 in what UN officials described as a potential war crime. After being notified to authorities by two rights groups, two Israeli individuals were arrested and questioned. They were detained in connection with an inquiry into war crimes. The two were arrested, according to two rights organisations, the Global Legal Action Network and the Hind Rajab Foundation, after they informed Belgian authorities that there was solid proof they were responsible for war crimes in Gaza.</p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">Using a legal concept known as "universal jurisdiction," which states that any state may prosecute an individual for a major violation of international law, regardless of the location of the crime, the group has been tracking down and attempting to apprehend Israeli soldiers who are elsewhere by using their social media posts. Following the start of the foundation's campaign, the Israel Defence Forces issued new guidelines prohibiting the media from identifying its soldiers and instructed IDF members not to share information about their activities in Gaza on social media.</p>
    <p class="sub-paragraph">The Hind Rajab Foundation and other legal organisations have called for the arrest of Israeli soldiers worldwide, which has caused some tourist Israelis to leave several nations. However, the organisation claimed that this was the first occasion that anyone had been detained by the police. Following the Foundation's founder, Lebanese-born Belgian activist Dyab Abou Jahjah, being accused by the Israeli government of being "anti-Israel" and of having sympathies with Hezbollah, a Shia armed group that is listed as a terrorist organisation in numerous nations, including Australia.Belgium's justice minister stated in May that a state security assessment had not discovered any hard proof of the group's connections to Hezbollah or of any harm to the Belgian state, despite pro-Israel MPs' attempts to have the group de-registered.</p>
